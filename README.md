# Delogic Container Library

Various applications, provided by [Delogic](https://delogic.io), containerized and ready to launch. Even though we mostly use these apps for internal purposes, we decided to share them.

## TL;DR

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/delogic-io/containers.git
$ cd APP/BASE-OS
$ docker build -t delogic-io/APP:TAG .
```

### Prerequisites

- Docker 19.03+

## Build example

You can build the image yourself by cloning the repository, switching directory containing the Dockerfile and executing the `docker build` command.

```bash
$ docker build -t delogic-io/nginx-geoip2:1.24.0-alpine .
```
